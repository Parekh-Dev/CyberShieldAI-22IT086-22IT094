# Backup and Recovery Strategy

## Overview
CyberShield AI implements a comprehensive backup and recovery system to ensure data integrity and business continuity.

## Backup Components
1. **Database**: Complete MongoDB database dumps
2. **Configuration**: Environment and Docker configuration files
3. **Compression**: Backups are compressed to save space

## Implementation

### Backup Script
The system includes a fully functional backup script located at ackup-tools/backup.sh that:
- Creates timestamped backups
- Dumps MongoDB data
- Backs up configuration files
- Compresses backups into archives
- Implements a 30-day retention policy

### Restore Capability
The restore script at ackup-tools/restore.sh allows for:
- Complete database restoration
- Recovery of configuration files
- Verification of restored data

## Execution Instructions

### On Linux/Mac
\\\ash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x backup-tools/*.sh

# Run backup
./backup-tools/backup.sh

# Restore from backup
./backup-tools/restore.sh backups/20240327_120000.tar.gz
\\\

### On Windows
\\\
# Run backup using batch file
backup-tools\backup.bat

# For restore, use WSL
wsl bash ./backup-tools/restore.sh backups/20240327_120000.tar.gz
\\\

## Scheduling
For production environments, backups should be scheduled:

### Linux Cron Job
\\\ash
# Add to crontab (daily at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/cybershield && ./backup-tools/backup.sh >> /var/log/cybershield-backup.log 2>&1
\\\

### Windows Task Scheduler
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger to run daily at 2 AM
4. Action: Start a program
5. Program: C:\path\to\cybershield\backup-tools\backup.bat

## Recovery Testing
Monthly recovery tests should be performed to validate backup integrity.
